## Project Overview
This project involves developing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for an enterprise named Business 360, focusing on five key business views:

### Finance View
### Marketing View
### Sales View
### Supply Chain View
### Executive View
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Data Sources
### SQL Database:
 Used to gather structured enterprise data related to financials, sales, and supply chain.
### Excel Sheets:

## Problem Statement
The enterprise required a unified platform to track and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) across various departments—finance, marketing, sales, supply chain, and executive operations. The main challenge was data silos and the lack of real-time, centralized reporting. The goal was to create a user-friendly dashboard that provides interactive insights and improves data-driven decision-making.
